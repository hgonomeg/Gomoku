# Gomoku

WORK IN PROGRESS

A simple implementation of the classic Gomoku game in C++ using SFML

## Dependencies

In order to compile Gomoku, the following libraries are required to be installed in the system (and maybe linked against):

* Nlohmann JSON (no linking; header-only)
* Rang (for terminal coloring; no linking; hearder-only)
* SFML (all modules but the Audio)
